# Welcome
Welcome to Velocity 2, a new client for Black Ops: II that has security and safety with more features e.g. Tunnels, Lua Engine & more!

# Lua Engine
What is the Lua Engine people might say, well it's a simple Lua Engine that replaces GSC with a more easier, and better implementation for scripting in Black Ops: II. this means it'll be easier to develop stuff for Black Ops: II's engine.

# Security & Safety
The security for Black Ops: II's client is horrible so we're redefining it with a better, and safer system.</br>
Currently I'm working on the Tunneling system that goes through servers globally to allow better Ping, and makes it almost impossible for anyone to grab IP addresses (they'll get replaced with a fake ip such as 0.0.0.0)

## Features:
* Tunneling (TODO)
  * Fake IP
  * Better Ping
* Lua Engine
  *  Add Functions
      * ???
  * Safer Bytecode (idk)
